# Tulkkaukset_H2
SpringBoot project with H2-database (Spring Boot, MVC, Maven, JPA, H2, Testing, Validation, Spring Security, Spring Integration: Email, REST) username: admin, passwd: admin;username: tulkki, passwd: tulkki;

This application has been developed for the needs of the interpreting agency. 
The administrator can log in to the system and delete, edit and add interpretations to the database. 
When logging in to the system, the interpreter only sees the information of the interpretations and cannot edit, add or delete them. 
Once a new interpretation has been added to the database, the interpreter will receive an e-mail in his / her e-mail. 
The same happens if the interpretation has been modified.
